LOL MICROKERNEL.

Yes yes I know, another gay OS, just trying something to learn stuff about kernel land ^_^

Used software:
    - app-emulation/qemu-0.11.0
    - sys-devel/clang-2.6-r1

If you have problems ensure that you're using those versions or don't bother meh.

To compile remember to download lolibc [http://github.com/meh/lolibc], extract it into lolibc/
and run make 32bit=1.

If you want to use GCC make sure to change the CC and CXX variables in the Makefiles.
