LOL MICROKERNEL.

Yes yes I know, another gay OS, just trying something to learn stuff about kernel land ^_^

Used software:
    - app-emulation/qemu-0.11.1
    - sys-devel/llvm-gcc-2.6
    - dev-lang/ruby-1.8.7
    - dev-ruby/rake-0.8.7

If you have problems ensure that you're using those versions or don't bother meh.

To compile remember to download lolibc [http://github.com/meh/lolibc], extract it into lolibc/
and run rake 32bit=1 ARCH=x86

If you want to use GCC make sure to change the CC and CXX variables in the Makefiles.
